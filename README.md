This project will updated weekly. 

First Edition:
We used a sample RAW dataset with custom CNN , but the accuracy was not satisfactory due to limited amount of Data.

Second Edition: 
We used pretrained CNN (ResNet50) and achieved a 87.5% Accuracy using RAW Dataset. Some fine tune parameters are used. 

Third Edition: 
We used semi supervised BYOL and SimCLR in the dataset.
